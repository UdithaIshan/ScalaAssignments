- **Assignment 1**

Write Scala functions to solve the following problems. 
1. The temperature is 35C; convert this temperature into Fahrenheit.
ºF =ºC * 1.8000 + 32.00
2. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Pi r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
3. Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs. 24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount.Shipping costs Rs. 3 for the first 50 copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?


- **Assignment 2**

Write Scala functions to solve the following problems. 
1. Company XYZ & Co. pays all its employees Rs.150 per normal working hour and Rs. 75 per OT hour. A typical employee works 40 (normal) and 20(OT) hours per week has to pay 10% tax. Develop a functional program that determines the take home salary of an employee from the number of working hours and OT hours given.
2.  Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets. In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship between the price of a ticket and average attendance.  At a price of Rs 15.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance. Decreasing the price by  5 Rupees increases attendance by 20 and increasing the price by  5 Rupees decreases attendance by 20. Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost. Every performance costs the owner Rs.500. Each attendee costs another 3 Rupees. The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at which he can make the highest profit. Implement a functional program to find out the best ticket price.


- **Assignment 3**

1. Can you write a recursive function prime(n) that returns true for a prime number and false for the other? 
For example prime(5) should return true and prime(8) should return false.
2. Can you write a recursive function primeSeq(n) that prints all 	prime number which less than n?
For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the terminal.
3. Can you write a recursive function returns the addition of numbers from1 to n?
For example sum(5) should print 15
4. Can you write a recursive function to determine even and odd numbers? 
5. Can you write a recursive function to get the addition of all even numbers less than given n.
6. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 
Write a recursive function print fist n Fibonacci numbers for given n.


- **Assignment 4**

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
1. Implement Encryption and Decryption functions of Caesar cipher.
2. Then implement a Cipher function which take Encryption and Decryption functions to process the data.


- **Assignment 5**

1. Implement a Data Structure for Rational Number and create a method neg to class Rational that is used like this: x.neg // evaluates to -x
2. Create a method sub to subtract two rational numbers and find an answer  x-y-z where x=3/4, y=5/8, z=2/7.
3. Implement a Data Structure for Account and create a method transfer which transfer the money from this account to a given account.
4.  A Bank defines as List of Accounts. So implement the following functions:
4.1 List of Accounts with negative balances
4.2 Calculate the sum of all account balances
4.3 Calculate the final balances of all accounts after apply the interest function as fallows: 
If balance is positive, deposit interest is .05  and if balance is negative, overdraft interest is .1




- **Assignment 6**

Implement a case class Point(x,y) and create following methods:
1. add(+) should add two given points
2. move should move a point by a given distance dx and dy
3. distance should return the distance between two given points
4. invert should switch the x and y coordinates.
